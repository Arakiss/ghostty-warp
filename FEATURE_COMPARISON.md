## ⚠️ Features We Have (Partial Parity)

### Navigation & Editing
| Feature | Warp | Our Setup | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Command completions** | ✅ 400+ tools | ⚠️ Limited | zsh completions (less extensive) |
| **Command corrections** | ✅ Auto-correct | ⚠️ Manual | Need to add `thefuck` or similar |
| **Vim keybindings** | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Manual | Add `bindkey -v` to .zshrc |

### Command Management
| Feature | Warp | Our Setup | Alternative |
|---------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Workflows** | ✅ Parameterized | ⚠️ Shell aliases | Could use `pet` (CLI snippet manager) |
| **Notebooks** | ✅ Interactive | ❌ None | Could use Jupyter + terminal kernel |

**Parity Score: ~70%** - Most functionality exists, needs configuration.

---

## ❌ Features We DON'T Have (Warp-Specific)

### AI Features
| Feature | Warp | Possible Alternative |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| **AI Command Suggestions** | ✅ Natural language → command | ⚠️ ChatGPT/Claude in browser |
| **Agent Mode** | ✅ AI executes tasks | ❌ Not possible locally |
| **Active AI** | ✅ Contextual suggestions | ❌ Proprietary |
| **AI Autofill** | ✅ Auto-naming workflows | ❌ Not possible |

**Why we can't replicate:**
- Requires cloud AI models
- Requires terminal integration with AI APIs
- Privacy concerns (we're avoiding telemetry)

**Workaround:**
- Use ChatGPT/Claude in browser for command help
- Copy-paste commands manually
- Use `tldr` for quick command examples

### Blocks Feature
| Feature | Warp | Our Setup |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Blocks** | ✅ Input/output grouped | ❌ Not possible |
| **Block sharing** | ✅ Permalink to block | ❌ Not possible |
| **Filter block output** | ✅ Search within block | ⚠️ Use `grep`/`less` |

**Why we can't replicate:**
- Requires terminal protocol changes
- Ghostty doesn't support block grouping
- No terminal emulator currently replicates this

**Closest alternative:**
- Use `tmux` logging
- Pipe output to files: `command | tee output.txt`

### Collaboration Features
| Feature | Warp | Our Setup |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Session sharing** | ✅ Live terminal sharing | ⚠️ `tmux` + `tmate` |
| **Team Drive** | ✅ Cloud workspace | ⚠️ Git repo (our approach) |
| **Web access** | ✅ Browser-based | ❌ Not possible |

**Alternatives:**
- **Session sharing**: Use `tmate` (tmux fork for sharing)
- **Team sharing**: Git repository (what we're doing)
- **Web access**: None (terminal-only)

### Enterprise Features
| Feature | Warp | Our Setup |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **SSO/SAML** | ✅ | ❌ N/A |
| **Secret redaction** | ✅ | ❌ Manual |
| **Zero data retention** | ✅ | ✅ Default (no cloud) |

**Parity Score: 0%** - These are Warp-specific, cloud-dependent features.

## 🔧 Features We Could Add

### High Impact, Easy to Add

**1. Command correction (`thefuck`)**
```bash
brew install thefuck
# Add to .zshrc:
eval $(thefuck --alias)
```
- Auto-corrects typos
- Suggests fixes for failed commands

**2. Vim mode in terminal**
```bash
# Add to .zshrc:
bindkey -v
```
- Vi-style keybindings
- Modal editing in terminal

**3. Better command completions**
```bash
brew install zsh-completions
# Add to .zshrc:
fpath+=/opt/homebrew/share/zsh-completions
```
- More tool completions
- Better parameter suggestions

**4. CLI snippet manager (`pet`)**
```bash
brew install knqyf263/pet/pet
```
- Save command snippets
- Parameterized commands (like Warp Workflows)
- Search and execute

**5. Terminal session sharing (`tmate`)**
```bash
brew install tmate
```
- Share terminal session via URL
- Read-only or interactive sharing
- Like Warp's session sharing

### Medium Impact, Moderate Effort

**6. Quick command reference (`tldr`)**
```bash
brew install tldr
```
- Simplified man pages
- Common use cases
- Faster than AI lookup

**7. Terminal multiplexer (`tmux`)**
```bash
brew install tmux
```
- Multiple panes/windows
- Session persistence
- Remote attachment

**8. Better file previews (`bat`, `eza`)**
```bash
brew install bat eza
alias cat='bat'
alias ls='eza'
```
- Syntax-highlighted file viewing
- Better `ls` with icons

## 📊 Overall Parity Analysis

### What We Match (95%+ parity)
- ✅ Core terminal features
- ✅ Auto-suggestions
- ✅ Syntax highlighting
- ✅ Fuzzy search
- ✅ History management
- ✅ Themes & customization
- ✅ GPU acceleration
- ✅ Shell compatibility

### What We Partially Match (50-80% parity)
- ⚠️ Command completions (less extensive)
- ⚠️ Workflows (aliases vs parameterized)
- ⚠️ Session sharing (tmate vs native)
- ⚠️ Team collaboration (git vs cloud)

### What We Can't Match (0% parity)

## 🎯 Verdict

### Core Terminal Experience: **95% Parity**
For day-to-day terminal use, we match or exceed Warp's functionality:
- Faster (no Electron, native GPU)
- More private (no telemetry)
- More customizable (full config access)
- Works offline (no cloud dependency)

### AI Features: **0% Parity**
We cannot replicate Warp's AI features without:
- Cloud API integration
- Telemetry (session context for AI)
- Proprietary ML models

**Trade-off:** Privacy & speed vs AI convenience.

### Collaboration: **40% Parity**
- Git-based sharing: ✅ (better for version control)
- Live session sharing: ⚠️ (tmate works, but not integrated)
- Cloud workspace: ❌ (not needed with git)

**Trade-off:** Manual git workflow vs automatic cloud sync.

## 🚀 Recommendations

### Keep As-Is (Already Good)
- zsh-autosuggestions
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- fzf
- atuin
- starship
- Ghostty config

### Easy Wins (Add These)
1. **thefuck** - Command corrections
2. **pet** - CLI snippet manager (Warp Workflows alternative)
3. **tldr** - Quick command reference (AI alternative)
4. **vim mode** - Just `bindkey -v`

### Nice to Have
1. **tmate** - Terminal sharing
2. **tmux** - Session management
3. **bat** - Better file viewing
4. **eza** - Better ls

### Skip These
- ❌ AI features (privacy trade-off not worth it)
- ❌ Blocks (no open-source alternative exists)
- ❌ Cloud features (git is better)

## 📝 Conclusion

**Can we replicate Warp 100%?** No.

**Can we replicate 95% of what matters?** Yes.

**What we lose:**
- AI command generation
- Blocks feature
- Cloud collaboration

**What we gain:**
- Privacy (zero telemetry)
- Speed (native, no Electron)
- Control (full config access)
- Offline (no internet needed)
- Free forever (no upsell)

**Final verdict:** Our setup matches Warp's core value prop (modern, productive terminal) while being faster, more private, and fully open source. The missing features are either:
1. Not critical for daily use (AI)
2. Have viable alternatives (tmate for sharing, pet for workflows)
3. Are trade-offs we're willing to make (privacy > convenience)
