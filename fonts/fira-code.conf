# AI NOTES FOR FIRA CODE:
# - LIGATURES ARE THE MAIN FEATURE - don't disable them!
# - font-thicken = false preserves the clean, thin aesthetic
# - Size 13-14 shows ligatures clearly without being too large
# - Excellent with modern themes (Tokyo Night, Catppuccin)
# - ss01-ss05 enable additional stylistic sets (arrows, etc.)
# - cursor-opacity = 0.9 prevents cursor from interfering with ligatures
# - Slightly more padding showcases the beautiful ligatures
# - Perfect for React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript
